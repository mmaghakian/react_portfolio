    description: `In making this website, the core concepts of web usability were followed.
     It was designed mobile-first, making every part of the experience responsive. 
    Parts of the site that do not fit on mobile layouts are removed at a certain screen width. The site makes sure to use minimal fonts, colours, and images to stay minimal and run smoothly on all platforms. This is important when 
     considering the variety of mobile devices that may access the site.`,

    description: `Images are crucial in multimedia for adding depth to what is being communicated. These images can break up the 
    monotony of bare text and can help convey emotions, information, and enhance or supplement the message being communicated. 
    
    For example, I recently took a vacation to Cuba, and took a picture of the hotel I was staying at. In the context of a blog post, the adding the image(s) is extremely important
    in engaging the audience and is a much better alternative to explaining the hotel through text exclusively.
    
    Furthermore, the images of Cuba provide the opportunity to format the blog and page in a more visually appealing manner. Overall, images are essential in effective
    multimedia communcation due to their ability to suppliment text, convey emotion, provide information, and add visual appeal.
    
    On the Topic of editing photos and images for use in mulimedia presentations, its important to use the highest quality images available, and proper software such as Adobe's photoshop.
    Make sure that the images are in a format that cooperates with most modern web browsers and that doesnt suffer when compressed or scaled up/down. For the example used in this lab, no editing was required, however
    I would turn to photoshop if adjustments were to be made.`,

    It is essential that when using animations for multimedia presentations that they are both simple and small. Animations are an effective tool at grabbing the reader's attention or to convey information that requires more than a static image, but is simple enough that a video isn't necessary.
