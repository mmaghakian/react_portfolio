     It was designed mobile-first, making every part of the experience responsive. 
    Parts of the site that do not fit on mobile layouts are removed at a certain screen width. The site makes sure to use minimal fonts, colours, and images to stay minimal and run smoothly on all platforms. This is important when 
     considering the variety of mobile devices that may access the site.`,
